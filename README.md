# Test Task

## Create a very simple Laravel web application for task management:

- Create task (info to save: task name, priority, timestamps)
- Edit task
- Delete task
- Reorder tasks with drag and drop in the browser.
  - Priority should automatically be updated based on this. #1 priority goes at top, #2 next down and so on.
- Tasks should be saved to a mysql table.
- BONUS POINT: add project functionality to the tasks.
  - User should be able to select a project from a dropdown and only view tasks associated with that project.
